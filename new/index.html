     <p class="headline2-format" align="center">Three Facts About Info-Products:</p>
    
  
  <ul>
<li class="check-icon">FACT: Most information products released don’t make a profit. Many struggle to break even.

</li>
<li class="check-icon">FACT: Your chances of releasing a hit information product is slim to none if you don’t know how online sales work.</li>
<li class="check-icon">FACT: Making money online with information products has changed dramatically in recent years.</li>
</ul> 
    
    </div>
  </div>
  </div>

<p class="title-format">Gone are the days of &ldquo;build it and they will Come&quot;.</p>
<p><em>The reality:</em> Even if you created the best information product in the galaxy ...if you  ignore TWO KEY FACTORS, your project is dead in the water!</p>
<p>What does your product need to succeed?<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Traffic and Trust!</p>
<p>Many information product marketers think they create demand for their &lsquo;hot new product&rsquo; by buying the &lsquo;right ads&rsquo; at the &lsquo;right places.&rsquo;<br />
  <br />
  Too many find out &ndash; several thousand dollars later &ndash; the Return on Investment for their hard-earned marketing dollars simply aren&rsquo;t there.</p>
    
  
    
<p>Other marketers think they can just &ldquo;blog their way to the top.&rdquo; </p>

    <p>After tens of thousands of words posted and who knows how many months wasted, these &lsquo;info product bloggers&rsquo; have very little to show for their time and effort.</p>
    
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: Buying ads and blogging CAN lead to success. But if you&rsquo;re starting out or you don&rsquo;t have the resources, the failure rate for those marketing strategies is simply too high to ignore.<br />
  <br />
What is the problem?</p>
    
<p class="title-format">You need a product that can PULL Targeted traffic from the Internet </p>
<p>It has to attract customers like a MAGNET.</p>
<p>You also need to post content to your target audience that builds their trust. This is almost impossible to do affordably if you&rsquo;re going to produce the content yourself or pay someone else to write it.</p>
<p>THE GOOD NEWS?</p>
<p>Thankfully, you can use a powerful SHORTCUT METHOD to attracting lots of eager visitors to your site while saving a fortune on content.<br />
  <br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li class="arrow-icon"><strong> FACT:</strong> Right now, there are many online communities made up of devoted fans of movie series, TV shows, book characters, and others called FANDOM.</li>
  <li class="arrow-icon"><strong> FACT:</strong> Fandom community members eagerly share content, join, and participate in a wide range of social media and other platforms talking about and sharing their love for their object of obsession..</li>
  <li class="arrow-icon"><strong> FACT:</strong> While relatively smaller in numbers, fandom communities generate a lot of fan-created content and buy lots of fandom related merchandise.</li>
  
  </ul> 
    
    <p class="title-style">Use FANDOM  To Solve Two Info-Business LETHAL PROBLEMS:&nbsp; </p>
    
  <div class="nobox"><p class="img-box" align="center"><img src="images/images-numbers.png" width="550" height="auto"></p>
</div>
  
    
    <p>Just by creating a fandom-specific platform, you can attract lots of eager fans without having to mortgage your home to buy content. </p>
<p>They supply the content themselves!&nbsp; </p>
<p>You just need to provide an engaging online place where they can relax and hang out with fellow community members.</p>
<p>Since fandom communities already exist online and can be found on almost all social media platforms, you can start pulling traffic from these today.</p>
<p><strong>No Need To &quot;Create Demand&quot; When It's Already There!</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely no &lsquo;pre-launch branding campaigns&rsquo; needed...</p>
<ul>
  <li class="dot-icon">The demand already exists. </li>
  <li class="dot-icon">The fans are already out there. </li>
  <li class="dot-icon">And they are motivated!</li>
</ul>
<p>So far so good, right?<br />
  <br />
  Understanding how Fandom works and appreciating its benefits is one thing, actually CASHING IN on fandom is another thing entirely... </p>
